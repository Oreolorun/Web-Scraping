# Web-Scraping

For this project, I built a web scraper paritcularly well suited for scraping and cleaning image data as it can extract img tags, download images using their src attribute, check for and delete duplicated images as well as delete all instances of non-pertinent images.

With the add of this scraper, I scraped and cleaned approximately 83,000 images which I used in building a car [classifier](github.com/Oreolorun/Image-Recognition). The scraper is built and tested in the WebScraper.ipynb file. It can also be accessed in the webscraper.py file.
